  //                    24
  // Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,
  // Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,
  // My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  // And perspective it is best painter's art.
  // For through the painter must you see his skill,
  // To find where your true image pictured lies,
  // Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
  // That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:
  // Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,
  // Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
  // Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
  // Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
  //   Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
  //   They draw but what they see, know not the heart.


  //                    25
  // Let those who are in favour with their stars,
  // Of public honour and proud titles boast,
  // Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
  // Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;
  // Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,
  // But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
  // And in themselves their pride lies buried,
  // For at a frown they in their glory die.
  // The painful warrior famoused for fight,
  // After a thousand victories once foiled,
  // Is from the book of honour razed quite,
  // And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
  //   Then happy I that love and am beloved
  //   Where I may not remove nor be removed.


  //                    26
  // Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
  // Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
  // To thee I send this written embassage
  // To witness duty, not to show my wit.
  // Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
  // May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;
  // But that I hope some good conceit of thine
  // In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:
  // Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
  // Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
  // And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
  // To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,
  //   Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
  //   Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.


  //                    27
  // Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
  // The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,
  // But then begins a journey in my head
  // To work my mind, when body's work's expired.
  // For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
  // Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
  // And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
  // Looking on darkness which the blind do see.
  // Save that my soul's imaginary sight
  // Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
  // Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)
  // Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
  //   Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,
  //   For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.


  //                    28
  // How can I then return in happy plight
  // That am debarred the benefit of rest?
  // When day's oppression is not eased by night,
  // But day by night and night by day oppressed.
  // And each (though enemies to either's reign)
  // Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
  // The one by toil, the other to complain
  // How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
  // I tell the day to please him thou art bright,
  // And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
  // So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,
  // When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
  //   But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
  //   And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
